#ResearchStack

##What is ResearchStack?

ResearchStack is an SDK and UX framework for building research study apps on Android.

##Is it similar to iOS ResearchKit(TM)?

Yes, an overriding goal of ResearchStack is to help developers and researchers with existing apps on iOS more easily adapt those apps for Android. Though the correspondence of features between the two SDKs isnâ€™t one-to-one, the two SDKs will offer enough shared functionality and a common framework and naming scheme to greatly speed up adaptation of ResearchKit(TM) apps to Android (and ResearchStack apps to iOS) and the procedural aspects of running a study on a new platform (such as IRB approval and secure connectivity with a data collection backend).

##How can I get started? Where is all the code?

Currently, ResearchStack is in alpha, with our beta version of the SDK projected to be publicly available in January 2016. If you would like to get started earlier with using ResearchStack, please contact Michael Carroll at michael.carroll@cornell.edu. We also would love it if you join the [ResearchStack forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/researchstack)!
